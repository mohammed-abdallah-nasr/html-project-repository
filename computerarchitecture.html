  <h3>What is computer architecture?</h3>
  What is computer architecture, it means computer architecture, that is, building a computer. For example, an architect specializes in drawing a building for the house we want and designs the entrances and exits, as well as in computer architecture, it explains the internal and external construction of the computer and how data enters and exits from it and how to process it. Computer architecture is a subject taught in engineering colleges, the Department of Computers, or any college related to computers. The course is concerned with building a computer mechanism and drawing it on paper to see how the data is transmitted and how we see it. Functions mean the movement of data and controlling it with arrows according to the given “instructions”.
  
  <h3>Computer</h3>
  A computer is a data-processing machine that operates automatically under the control of a list of instructions (called a program) stored in its main memory.

The computer consists of:-
  
  <ul>
  <li>Input device</li>
  <li>Output device</li>
  <li>Secondary memory</li>
</ul>

Von Neumann's Architecture Principles
1- The data and instructions are stored in the main memory (the concept of the program is stored).
2- The content of the memory is an addressable that is done by the site without regard to what is stored in this site.
3- The instructions are executed sequentially, from the first instruction to the next, in an orderly manner, in the order of their location, unless this system is modified.
4- The structure of the computer is:
  <ul>
  <li>CPU The central processing unit contains the CU, which coordinates the execution of instructions, and the ALU, which performs arithmetic and logical operations.</li>
  <li>Main Memory<li>
</ul>
The technologies used in computers have changed, as they can solve many different problems depending on the program that executes them on the computer.
Contrary to what was in the beginning when the computer was a memory that preserves data and is unable to solve mathematical operations.

<h3>Architecture Numan Von Purpose General</h3>

1- The main task of the CPU is to carry out the instructions that come to it from the main memory.
2- The CPU is told that it must perform one of the basic operations (may be arithmetic or logical) in order to transfer data to and from the main memory.
3- The control unit (CU) is the one that interprets/translates the instruction coming to it from main memory, and it also tells various other items what to do.
4- The CPU unit includes a set of “Records” which are usually considered as temporary storage devices for the data that is being processed inside the CPU.

<h3>Representation of data</h3>

All data and control information “instructions” inside the computer are represented by the “system binary” which uses only two symbols, either 0 or 1; The two symbols 1.0 are represented in the computer by electrical signals, where 0 means the absence of the signal, 1 means its presence.
Binary numbers add, subtract, multiply and divide using ALU directly without the need to convert them to the system decimal system.

Through the sequence of binaries in the computer, a specific instruction can be represented, where each sequence is divided into three parts. Through these parts, it is possible to know what is required of this instruction.
  <ul>
  <li>The first part means the type of operation, which is called an opcode.</li>
  <li>The second part is the value that we need to fetch from memory to enter into it
      The instruction memory operand.</il>
  <li>And the last part, which is the place where the product will be placed.</li>
</ul>
Example:- Operation (Mov R1 Y)

That is, put the y-value in register R1 and that means that the type of operation is MOV transfer and that the element we will fetch from memory is y and the destination will be R1.

<h3>Types Of Machine Instructions</h3>
  <ul>
  <li>Transfer data from memory and CPU registers.</li>
  <li> Arithmetic and logical operations.</li>
  <li>Program control.</li>
  <li> Transfer during the input and output operations.</li>
To perform an arithmetic operation such as 3*(Z=(X+Y), this arithmetic operation will be divided into four instructions, where the first instruction is
Put the variable Y in one of the CPU registers, and suppose it is R3, i.e. transfer the value of Y to register R3 in this way

MOV Y R3

Then, in the second instruction, we add the variable X to the value in R1, so the instruction is

ADD X+R3 R3

In the third instruction, we multiply the value 3 by the register R1

MUL 3#R3 R3

The last instruction is to take the output from R1 and put it at the value Z

MOV R3 Z
<h3>The Control Unit</h3>

The analysis of the instruction, such as the process of combining R2, R1, needs a controller, and in general, the one who controls the synchronous operations, ie
Time is the CPU, but in particular, the one that controls this synchronization is the Control Unit.

Techniques implemented by the control unit:
  <ul>
  <li>Hardwired Control</li>
  <li>Micro programmed Control</li>
</ul>  

<h3>The Computer System</h3>
The CPU & Memory Main together form the core of the Computer System, and the secondary memory and I/O devices are called peripherals.
Communication between the various components of a system is usually done using one or more buses.

<h1>Memories</h1>
Memory features:
  <ul>
  <li>Main memory is used to store programs and data that are processed by the CPU.</li>
  <li> Secondary memory provides long-term storage for large amounts of data and programs.</li>
  <li>The CPU can manage data and programs in secondary memory before loading them to main memory.</li>
  <li>The most important characteristics of memory are speed, size and cost, as well as the technology you use is very useful when executing.</li>
  <li>The main memory is usually fast in execution but of limited size, while the secondary memory is relatively slow but of very large size.</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Main Memory</h2>
The main memory can be viewed as a group of storage cells, each of which is used to store the word “word”.
Each cell assigns a unique address in the form of sequential numbers.
In addition to the storage cells, there is a “memory address buffer” that stores the address of the word to be read or written.

Also, there is a “data buffer” to store the data you want to write or write
read it.


 
There is also a so-called “address decoder” and “Memory Control unit” and the “Memory Control Unit”.
Often and on a large scale, a technique is used to implement the main memories, which are semiconductor memories.

The common type of semiconductor memory is random access memory (RAM), and the information stored in “RAM” semiconductor memory will be lost when the power is cut off.


<h2>The Secondary Memory</h2>
<h3>1-disk Hard</h3>
Data is recorded on a hard disk surface made of magnetically coated metal.
(disks & drives) are usually built together and covered in a close container to protect the disks from contaminants such as smoke and dust particles. Likewise, all disks are usually stacked on a movable shaft in which all disks, regardless of their reading or writing function, share.
<h4>The main advantages:</h4>
  <ul>
  <li>Direct access.</li>
  <li>The speed of access is “fast success” where the time seek is approximately 10ms and the data transfer rate is approximately 5MB/s.</li>
  <li>Large storage capacity, from 8 MB to several GB.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Diskette</h2>
Data is recorded on the Floppy Disk, which is made of polyester and covered with magnetic material.
His floppy disk drive must be used to communicate the data stored in the Floppy Disk, and it works like a record turntable on a gramophone.

<h4>The main advantages:</h4>
  <ul>
  <li>Direct Access</li>
  <li>cheap</li>
  <li>Portable and easy to use.</li>
<h3>tape Magnetic</h3>

The magnetic tape consists of a plastic layer coated with iron oxide, where the iron oxide can be magnetized in different directions to be able to better represent the data.
The magnetic tape is operated by a similar principle as in the case of the tape recorder.
<h4>The main advantages:</h4>
  <ul>
  <li>Sequential access, where the access time is 1-5 seconds.</li>
  <li>High value of storage “50MB/table”.</li>
  <li>“inexpensive”</li> .
</ul>
<h3> Memory Optical</h3>
  <ul>
  <li>775MB/disk huge capacity.</li>
  <li>Reasonable price “huge capacity”.</li>
  <li>Removable.</li>
  <li>Read only.</li>
  <li>Long access time.</li>
</ul>
